# Movie-recommender
Python web scraping

How to use:
  - first of all you are going to need your very own API key to get detailed information of the movie. You can get a FREE API key here: http://www.omdbapi.com/
  - once you have your API key copy it and paste it into the ```py omdbApi_key``` varialbe
  - make sure you have all the imports already installed on your computer
  - run the application from Pycharm or any other IDE
  - press the big red RECOMMEND button to generate a random movie
Optional, if you want to run the app like an .exe file instead of running it from an IDE:
  - install pyinstaller in command prompt using ```pip install pyinstaller``` (WINDOWS)
  - open up your python project folder in command line prompt
  - to make an .exe file use this command: ```pyinstaller main.py --onefile -w```
  - after that navigate to your project folder, open ```dist``` folder and you should have a main.exe file that you can open.
