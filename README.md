Python web scraping

IMPORTANT:
  - every individual should be able to generate their own API key and be kept private. Do NOT share your key with anyone!

How to use:
  - first of all you are going to need your very own API key to get detailed information about the movie. You can get a FREE API key here: http://www.omdbapi.com/
  - once you have your API key, copy it and paste it into the ```omdbApi_key``` variable
  - make sure you have all the imports already installed on your computer
  - run the application from Pycharm or any other IDE
  - press the big red RECOMMEND button to generate a random movie

Optional, if you want to run the app like an .exe file instead of running it from an IDE:
  - install ```pyinstaller``` in command prompt using ```pip install pyinstaller``` (WINDOWS)
  - open up your python project folder in command prompt
  - to create an .exe file use the following command: ```pyinstaller main.py --onefile -w```
  - after that, navigate to your project folder and you should see 3 new folders. Open up your newly created ```dist``` folder and you should have a ```main.exe``` file that you can open.
